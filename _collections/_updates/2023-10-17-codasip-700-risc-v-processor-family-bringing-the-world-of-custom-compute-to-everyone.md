Today, technology innovators must have new ways to create differentiated products. How are they supposed to meet the
demand for more computational performance when semiconductor scaling laws are showing their limits? There is only one
way: having a compute that is custom for specific needs. And what do we need for that? Several aspects: Architecture
optimization, application profiling, hardware/software co-optimization, and domain-specific acceleration built on a
strong design foundation. And this is great, but the design process must be as streamlined as possible to improve
efficiency and reduce time to market while allowing companies to take ownership and remain flexible.
