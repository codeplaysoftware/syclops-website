We, Codasip had the pleasure of sponsoring and hosting a hackathon at the RISC-V Summit North America 2024 in Santa Clara, California. As part of our commitment to advancing CPU design, we invited participants to take on a challenging technical mission that tested their skill through Codasip Studio, our advanced design tool. This tool, along with CodAL—our unique C-like language—enabled participants to create sophisticated custom CPU logic that could handle one of the most unforgiving environments: deep space.
