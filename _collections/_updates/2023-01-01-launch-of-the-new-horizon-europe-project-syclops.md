<h2>8 leading European organisations join forces to bring together RISC-V and SYCL standards to demonstrate 
ground-breaking advances in scalability of extreme data analytics via fully-open AI acceleration</h2>

The wide-spread adoption of AI has resulted in a market for novel hardware accelerators that can efficiently process 
AI workloads. Unfortunately, all popular AI accelerators today use proprietary hardwareâ€”software stacks, leading to 
a monopolization of the acceleration market by a few large industry players.

Eight leading European organizations have joined in an effort to break this monopoly via Horizon Europe project 
SYCLOPS (Scaling extreme analYtics with Cross-architecture acceleration based on Open Standards). **The vision of 
SYCLOPS is to democratize AI acceleration using open standards, and enabling a healthy, competitive, 
innovation-driven ecosystem for Europe and beyond**. This vision relies on the convergence of two important 
trends in the industry: (i) the standardization and adoption of RISC-V&reg;, a free, open Instruction Set Architecture 
(ISA), for AI and analytics acceleration, and (ii) the emergence and growth of SYCL&trade; as a cross-vendor, 
cross-architecture, data parallel programming model for all types of accelerators, including RISC-V.

The goal of project SYCLOPS is to bring together these standards for the first time in order to demonstrate 
ground-breaking advances in performance and scalability of extreme data analytics using a standards-based, 
fully-open, AI acceleration approach.

The project kicked off its activities in January 2023 with an online meeting, where all partners took the 
floor to present their ambitious plans to make the project a success. SYCLOPS brings together consortium 
partners will expertise in several fields (computer architecture, programming languages, systems and runtimes, 
Big Data, High- Performance Computing) with the aim of making groundbreaking advances over state-of-the-art in 
AI acceleration along three axes: (i) infrastructure tools for simple, fast, cost-efficient customization of RISC-V 
accelerators, (ii) platform tools (compiler, runtime, interpreter) for SYCL-based cross-architecture programming, 
(iii) application tools (parallel algorithms, profiling and porting tools) for cross-architecture AI and analytics 
acceleration.

The project will demonstrate its solutions in three use-cases, namely, Autonomous Systems, High-Energy Physics, 
and Precision Oncology. More broadly, **the advances made by SYCLOPS will foster an open European and global ecosystem 
of AI acceleration solutions for scaling extreme analytics based on SYCL and RISC-V standards**. SYCLOPS will 
reinforce European leadership in the rapidly growing AI acceleration market by bringing together key European 
SME partners who have played a crucial role in the formation of these standards. The experience gained in SYCLOPS 
will also be used to contribute back to the SYCL and RISC-V standards; bringing together the two standards enables 
co-design in both standards, which in turn, will enable a broader AI accelerator design space, and a richer 
ecosystem of solutions.
