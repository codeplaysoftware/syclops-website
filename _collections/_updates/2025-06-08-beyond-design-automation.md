If you’ve been following us at Codasip, you know we’re all about enabling Custom Compute. The power to shape processor hardware to get the best out of your software is, as we see it, key to standing out and getting that crucial edge in performance, power, and area. A big part of what we offer here is Codasip Studio, our processor design toolset, and its architectural language, CodAL. Many engineers know Studio for its powerful ability to generate both a Hardware Development Kit (HDK) and a Software Development Kit (SDK) – that’s compilers, debuggers, models, the whole lot – all from one CodAL description. That alone is a huge time saver, especially when you’re innovating with your own custom instructions. 

In this blog, we take you deeper into another side of Codasip Studio that we find incredibly powerful, especially when we’re managing processor IP that comes in many different flavors. It’s something that might not be immediately obvious but is critical for serious processor development. Management of configurable processor IP.
