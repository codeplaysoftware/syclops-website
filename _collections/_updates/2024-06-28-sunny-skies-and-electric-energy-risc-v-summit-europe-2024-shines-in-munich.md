As I sat on the plane in Boston it’s fair to say that I was curious about what DAC 2024 would bring. The previous year
was much better than I expected but a cold June in San Francisco wasn’t exactly what I was dreaming about. Afterall,
while I was heading to San Francisco with a bunch of other Codasippers some of the Codasip team was headed for the
RISC-V Summit in Munich.

The event is nowhere on the scale that it used to be. In fact, the entire exhibit could probably now fill one floor of
the Moscone. But the level of foot traffic remained high throughout the show and the team and I spoke to a fair number
of people over the 3 days of exhibits. I was impressed with the number of fresh faces and new startups. There was
something interesting to see in all corners of the tradeshow floor. And… incredibly the weather was, well, incredible.
