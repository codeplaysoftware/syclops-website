This week, the 2024 edition of RISC-V Summit Europe took place in lovely Munich, Germany. Those of us who attended last
yearâ€™s edition in Barcelona might not have expected the same weather but Munich was up for the challenge and served us a
sunny, hot week, only interrupted by a thunderstorm that shook up some conference attendees (including me!) on the
Wednesday afternoon. However, thunderbolts and lightning were also present in a less literal form as massive applause
following the many talks, and an abundance of photos and selfies taken in the expo hall and at the social events.
