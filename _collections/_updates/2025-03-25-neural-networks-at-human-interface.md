Someone asked me how many Embedded Worlds I’ve attended, and I honestly couldn’t give an exact answer. Is it 10? 12? 15? I’m not sure, but one thing’s for certain: I’m always excited to return. So, what makes this event so special? It’s not just the technical innovations that continue to impress; Embedded World is all about the people. Curious, knowledgeable, and friendly. At one point during the week, four PhDs in Physics were enjoying a lively conversation at our booth. To be fair, some of them were my colleagues, but that kind of interaction isn’t something you experience every day!
